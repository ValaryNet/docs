## Common Fixes:

### Channel build mismatch

-\> Go to https://rdd.weao.gg/ and press "Download Latest Version", use the Roblox that gets downloaded. If https://discord.com/channels/1289988589052104846/1344419248113455124 is red then downgrade to the latest version that potassium supports.

### Driver Errors

Press Win + R, type regedit, and press Enter. Navigate to: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\CI\\Config. Find a DWORD (32-bit) value named VulnerableDriverBlocklistEnable. Right click it and press "Modify" and set the data value to "0" Restart your PC.

try 1 and 4 https://www.ninjaone.com/blog/enable-or-disable-microsoft-vulnerable-driver-blocklist/

### Could not find a part of the path

-\> Extract the Potassium zip and make sure to run the executable from file explorer (**SHORTCUTS OR OPENING FROM THE START MENU WILL NOT WORK**)

### Mismatched HWID (**IN ROBLOX**)

-\> This is related to the script you are using, reset your HWID in the script (**WE ARE NOT SCRIPT SUPPORT, IF YOU OPEN A TICKET REGARDING THIS, WE WILL TICKET BAN YOU**)

### Mismatched HWID (**IN POTASSIUM**)

-\> Message the bot "/reset_hwid" and it will reset your HWID (**WE ARE NOT BYPASSING COOLDOWNS, IF YOU OPEN A TICKET REGARDING THIS, WE WILL TICKET BAN YOU**)

### Injection not working

1. ​Disable Windows Defender and add the Potassium folder to the exclusions
2. ​Reinstall Roblox
3. ​Clear %temp%
4. ​Clear cache
